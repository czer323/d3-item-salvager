# Diablo 3 Item Salvager - Services Module

## Services Overview

This module contains the business logic for the application. It is responsible for orchestrating the interactions between the other modules to perform specific tasks.

### Item Salvage Service

The `ItemSalvageService` is a placeholder service that is intended to contain the business logic for salvaging items. It is initialized with a database session and the application configuration.

### Usage

The `ItemSalvageService` is provided through dependency injection in the API module. You can also instantiate it directly:

```python
from sqlmodel import Session
from d3_item_salvager.config.settings import AppConfig
from d3_item_salvager.services.item_salvage import ItemSalvageService

# Assume db_session and config are available
db_session: Session = ...
config: AppConfig = ...

service = ItemSalvageService(db_session, config)
result = service.salvage_item("123")
```

## Discrepancies

- The `ItemSalvageService` is a placeholder and does not contain any actual business logic. The `salvage_item` method is a stub that returns a hardcoded response.
- The `pylint: disable=too-few-public-methods` comment indicates that the service currently has only one public method. This is not a major issue, but it suggests that the service might not be fully implemented. As more business logic is added, this comment may no longer be necessary.
- The service is tightly coupled to the `AppConfig` and `Session` types. As the application grows, it might be beneficial to use more abstract types or protocols to reduce coupling.
