# Task Scheduling / Background Jobs Module â€“ Implementation Plan

## Domain & Purpose

Handles periodic scraping, cache refresh, and maintenance tasks. Ensures background jobs are robust, observable, and easy to extend.

## Directory Structure

```directory
src/d3_item_salvager/workers/
    __init__.py
    tasks.py         # Background job definitions
    scheduler.py     # Task scheduling logic
```

## Tools & Libraries

- `APScheduler` or `Celery` or `Dramatiq` (choose based on needs)
- Python stdlib

## Design Patterns

- Task classes/functions
- Scheduler setup/config

## Key Functions & Classes

- `scrape_guides_task()`: Periodic scraping
- `refresh_cache_task()`: Cache refresh
- `setup_scheduler()`: Scheduler initialization

## Implementation Details

- Document all tasks and scheduling intervals
- Ensure tasks are idempotent and robust to errors
- Integrate with logging for observability
- Example usage:

  ```python
  from d3_item_salvager.workers.scheduler import setup_scheduler
  scheduler = setup_scheduler()
  scheduler.add_job(scrape_guides_task, 'interval', hours=6)
  ```

- Choose scheduler based on deployment needs (APScheduler for simple, Celery/Dramatiq for distributed)

## Testing & Extensibility

- Unit tests for all tasks and scheduler logic
- Add new jobs by creating new functions in `tasks.py` and registering in `scheduler.py`
- Document all background job changes in this file and in code docstrings

## Example Task Function

```python
def scrape_guides_task():
    """Background job to scrape build guides periodically."""
    # Scraping logic here
    pass
```

## Summary

This module provides robust, observable background job and scheduling logic for the project. All jobs must be documented, tested, and integrated with logging for reliability and maintainability.
